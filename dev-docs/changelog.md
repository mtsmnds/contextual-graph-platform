# Changelog

## Purpose
Significant completed changes with reasoning and references.
Use this to recover context after breaks.

## Entry Rules
- Completed, meaningful changes only (not tentative ideas).
- Short entries: what changed, why, impact.
- Significant design/process changes need a paired ADR in `archive/`.

### Architectural pivot: decouple domain model from React Flow
- **What:** Adopted the architecture review recommendation to restructure the system as Entity Graph → Projection Layer → Renderer. React Flow demoted from core runtime to optional spatial renderer (Phase 4+). Roadmap reordered to validate contextual reading before graph visualization.
- **Reason:** The original plan coupled domain state to canvas coordinates and React Flow internals, which would make reading workspace UX brittle. Decoupling lets us validate the core interaction (contextual reading) without fighting canvas complexity.
- **Files changed:**
  - `dev-docs/roadmap.md`: Full rewrite with 4 new milestones
- **Impact:** The immediate work shifts from building custom graph nodes to refactoring the domain schema and building a reading workspace. React Flow work deferred to Phase 4.

### Typed graph schema and Zustand store
- **What:** Created the typed data layer and global state management for the graph system, replacing the stock Vite template.
- **Reason:** Establish the foundation before building any UI — NodeKind/EdgeKind types, store actions, and a React Flow canvas.
- **Files changed:**
  - `src/types/graph.ts`: Node/Edge TypeScript types with React Flow integration
  - `src/store/useGraphStore.ts`: Zustand store with mutation actions and seed data
  - `src/App.tsx`: React Flow canvas (replaced stock Vite demo template)
  - `src/main.tsx`: Entrypoint (migrated to TypeScript)
  - `tsconfig.json`: Strict TypeScript config
  - `package.json`: Added typescript, zustand
  - `index.html`: Script ref → main.tsx
- **Impact:** Foundation for all future graph features. No visual custom nodes yet.
- **ADR:** N/A — scaffolding, not a design decision requiring an ADR.
