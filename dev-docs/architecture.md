# Architecture

## Purpose
How the system is designed and where core responsibilities live.

## System Architecture

```
Entity Graph → Projection Layer → Renderer

Persistence:
  IndexedDB ←↔ Store (always — runtime persistence via IndexedDBAdapter)
  Disk        ← UI open/save/close (explicit checkpoints via FSAdapter)
```

The core is a **Relation-Native Content Engine**. Entities carry content directly. Relations carry typed links. Projections interpret the graph for a specific use case. Renderers display projections.

IndexedDB is always the runtime store. FS disk operations are invoked only by explicit user action (Open Folder, Save). No auto-save to disk, no background sync, no silent reconnect.

Two active renderers share the same Zustand store, reading and writing the same data:

- **Text view** — the current priority. Pure-React reading-and-navigation interface for the entity graph. Containers render as collapsible cards with inline content editing. A navigable workspace tree shows the container hierarchy. No React Flow dependency — all layout is standard block/scroll.
- **Graph canvas** — spatial/structural visualization using React Flow. Nodes positioned on an infinite canvas with edges, handles, and context menus. The canvas remains available as a spatial tool for organizing entity relationships.

Guiding principle: *The graph is infrastructure. The viewport is the product. Renderers are interchangeable. Contextual reading is the core interaction.*

## System Style
- Architecture style: React SPA with a content-graph engine at the core
- Deployment style: Tauri-packaged desktop app (dev via `npm run dev`)
- Execution model: Client-side SPA, no server

## Component Architecture

### Container/Presenter Pattern

Stateful UI components follow a container/presenter split:

- **Presenter** — a pure render function. Accepts all data and callbacks as explicit props. Zero side effects, zero store imports. Default export from the `.tsx` file. Used directly in Storybook stories.
- **Container** — owns store reads, async orchestration, dialog state, and effects. Renders the presenter with props derived from state. Named `{Name}Container.tsx` alongside the presenter.

```
sections/
  FeatureFlagsSection.tsx          ← presenter (props: flags, onToggle)
  FeatureFlagsSectionContainer.tsx ← container (reads useGraphStore)
  BackupsSection.tsx               ← presenter (all state + callbacks as props)
  BackupsSectionContainer.tsx      ← container (owns dialogs + backup ops)
```

Container always renders exactly one presenter. Presenters never import the store. This makes presenters isolatable for Storybook and unit tests without mocking.

### Storybook

**Decorators for providers:** Use decorators for provider/layout wrapping
(`SidebarProvider`, context providers, layout containers). Stories should only
show the component and its props in the code panel. Use `parameters` for per-story
configuration passed to the decorator.

**Never wrapper components:** Never create wrapper components (e.g., `SidebarDemo`)
as the story's `component`. Use real components directly in `render` or let the
decorator + `component` default handle it.

**JSDoc on every component:** Every component exported from `src/` should have a
JSDoc description explaining what it does and when to use it. Storybook picks
these up automatically for the docs page.

**ArgTypes with descriptions:** Every prop needs a description in `argTypes`,
not just a type. One line explaining what it controls.

**Stories are use cases, not prop permutations:** Each story represents a
meaningful, visually distinct state (e.g., "With multiple backups", "Empty workspace",
"Loading state"). If two stories render identically, remove one.

**Mock data fixtures:** Create mock data in a `__mocks__` or `__fixtures__` directory
colocated with stories. Reuse across stories and tests.

**Presenters:** Accept explicit props with `fn()` callbacks for actions. Interactive
stories use stateful `render` wrappers for controlled components.

Global decorators in `.storybook/preview.tsx` provide `BrowserRouter`. Shared
section decorators live in `.storybook/decorators.tsx`.

## Tech Stack
- Vite 8 + React 19 + TypeScript
- Zustand 5 — global state
- Vitest — unit testing (pure functions, store actions, state transitions)
- Storybook 10 — component development environment (isolated rendering + interaction tests)
- @xyflow/react (React Flow) — optional graph renderer (Phase 4+, installed but not imported)
- @phosphor-icons/react — icon library
- Native CSS nesting (no preprocessor)
- TipTap — rich text editor
- @dagrejs/dagre — auto-layout

## Build Pipeline
Entrypoint: `npm run build` → `vite build`

1. **Vite dev** (`npm run dev`) — esbuild transpilation, HMR, static file serving.
2. **Type check** (`npx tsc --noEmit`) — static type verification.
3. **Unit tests** (`npx vitest run`) — state/logic coverage via vitest.
4. **Production build** (`npm run build`) — rolldown bundling, CSS/JS minification, output to `dist/`.

## Data Contracts

### Domain Model (`src/types/graph.ts`)

#### Entity
The atomic semantic object. Two roles:

- **Containers** (`kind: "container"`) — structural labels with `title`. Their body content lives in a separate content store (`react-roadmap:content:{id}` in localStorage), not inline on the entity. This keeps the graph lightweight and queryable without parsing document bodies. Examples: work ("Hamlet"), note ("Meeting Notes").
- **Segments** (`kind: "segment"`) — legacy content carriers from the hamlet import. They have both `title` and inline `content` (plain text). New documents use containers with external content storage instead.

```ts
type EntityKind = "segment" | "container" | "annotation" | "concept" | "summary"

type Entity = {
  id: string
  kind: EntityKind
  title?: string         // container heading or segment label
  content?: string       // LEGACY: body text for hamlet segments only. Containers store content externally via getContent/saveContent.
  metadata: Record<string, unknown>   // type-specific data (e.g. character name, work type)
}
```

#### Relation
Typed edge between entities. No `EdgeBehavior` — behavior belongs to the interaction layer, not storage.

```ts
type RelationType = "contains" | "next" | "references" | "annotates" | "summarizes" | "related_to"

type Relation = {
  id: string
  source: string
  target: string
  type: RelationType
  metadata: Record<string, unknown>
}
```

Key relation patterns:
- `contains` — hierarchy (work → act → scene → segments)
- `next` — document order chain within a container
- `annotates` — annotation linked to a segment
- `references` — cross-work reference

#### View State
Separate from domain state entirely.

```ts
type ViewState = {
  focusedEntityId: string | null   // the root container in view (resolved to work)
  anchorEntityId: string | null    // the original entity clicked (for breadcrumb)
  visibleEntityIds: string[]
  expandedPanels: string[]
}
```

### Store (`src/store/useGraphStore.ts`)
- `entities: Entity[]` — domain graph entities (lightweight: no inline content for containers).
- `relations: Relation[]` — typed edges.
- `view: ViewState` — UI-only state, separate from domain.
- `contentLoaded: Record<string, boolean>` — tracks which container contents have been loaded from storage.
- `adapterId: string` — always `"indexeddb"` at runtime (resolver no longer supports FS as persistence backend).
- `folderName: string | null` — folder name when FSAdapter is active (set by `openFromDisk`, cleared by `closeDisk`/`closeWorkspace`).
- `lastDiskSaveAt: number` — timestamp of the last successful save to disk (set by `openFromDisk` and `saveToDisk`).
- `isDirty(): boolean` — `lastMutationTime > lastDiskSaveAt`. Returns true when unsaved changes exist.
- Initialization: `init(adapter)` — injects the `IndexedDBAdapter` at startup. Checks `localStorage` flag `react-roadmap:folder-open` before restoring IndexedDB data. If the flag is set (stale folder session from a reload without FS handle), forces seed data instead. Otherwise calls `loadWorkspace()`, applies version migration, loads container content docs. Falls back to seed data if the adapter returns no workspace.
- Mutations: `addEntity`, `updateEntity`, `deleteEntity`, `addRelation`, `updateRelation`, `removeRelation`.
- View actions: `focusEntity(id, anchorId?)`, `expandPanel`, `closePanel`.
- Content actions: `getContent(id)` — reads from in-memory content cache; `saveContent(id, data)` — writes to cache + adapter's `saveDocument()`; `clearContent(id)` — removes from cache + adapter's `deleteDocument()`. Container document bodies are NOT stored on the entity.
- FS actions: `openFromDisk(snapshot, folderName)` — replaces entities/relations/canvas, resets undo/redo, sets `folderName` + `lastDiskSaveAt`, sets localStorage flag. `saveToDisk()` — calls `_fsAdapter.save()` with current snapshot, sets `lastDiskSaveAt`. `closeDisk()` — calls `_fsAdapter.close()`, clears `folderName` + localStorage flag. `closeWorkspace()` — resets to seed data via `generateSeedData()`, clears adapter + FS handles + localStorage flag.
- ID scheme: New containers use `generateDocId()` (timestamp-based `doc_{timestamp}`); segments use `{parent}_seg-{counter}`; root entities use slugified title.
- Persistence: Auto-save is debounced (300ms) — writes `GraphSnapshot` (entities + relations) to IndexedDB's `saveGraph()` on every entity/relation change. Content docs go through `saveDocument()`. No auto-save to disk.
- `generateSeedData()` — module-level helper that produces fresh seed entities/relations/container content from `SEED_DATA`. Used by `init`'s seed branch and `closeWorkspace`.
- URL sync: On view state change, `focusedEntityId` and `anchorEntityId` are synced to URL search params (debounced 200ms, `history.replaceState`). On app load, URL params are read to restore the view.

### Persistence Layer (`src/store/persistence/`)

IndexedDB is always the runtime store. The FS adapter is a standalone module invoked by explicit user action only.

#### IndexedDBAdapter (runtime backend)

Implements `PersistenceAdapter` for runtime persistence:

```ts
interface PersistenceAdapter {
  readonly id: AdapterType  // "indexeddb"
  loadWorkspace(): Promise<WorkspaceSnapshot | null>
  saveGraph(snapshot: WorkspaceSnapshot): Promise<void>
  loadDocument(id: string): Promise<Record<string, unknown> | null>
  saveDocument(id: string, data: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void>
  deleteDocument(id: string): Promise<void>
  getFolderName(): string | null   // always returns null
  getRootHandle?(): FileSystemDirectoryHandle | null  // always returns null
}
```

- Uses Dexie.js for IndexedDB access (async, unlimited quota for current scale). Table `graph` stores the workspace snapshot; table `documents` stores per-container content docs. No user interaction needed.

#### FSAdapter (explicit disk checkpoint)

Standalone class (NOT a `PersistenceAdapter`). Invoked by the UI layer only:

```ts
class FSAdapter {
  open(): Promise<GraphSnapshot | null>       // picker → read → validate
  save(snapshot: GraphSnapshot): Promise<void> // write graph.json
  close(): void                                // clear handle + log
  isOpen(): boolean
  getFolderName(): string | null
  getRootHandle(): FileSystemDirectoryHandle | null
  getStatus(): FSAdapterStatus
  getLog(): FSLogEntry[]
}
```

- Uses raw File System Access API (`showDirectoryPicker`, `getFileHandle`, `createWritable`).
- Reads/writes `graph.json` only — does NOT handle per-document files (out of scope).
- `open()` returns `null` if user cancels the picker. Also returns `null` if the folder has no `graph.json` (caller checks `isOpen()` to distinguish from cancel). Throws `FSError` on permission/parse/validation/version errors.
- Includes `validateSnapshot()` for schema validation and a 100-entry ring-buffer operation log.

#### FSError

Typed error with machine-readable code:

```ts
type FSErrorCode =
  | "PERMISSION_DENIED"      // handle expired or permission revoked
  | "NOT_FOUND"              // graph.json does not exist (open() returns null instead of throwing)
  | "PARSE_FAILED"           // file exists but is not valid JSON
  | "VALIDATION_FAILED"      // JSON is valid but shape is wrong
  | "VERSION_TOO_NEW"        // file version > app supported version
  | "WRITE_FAILED"           // file write failed (disk full, permission, etc.)
  | "NO_FOLDER_OPEN"         // operation attempted without an open folder
  | "USER_CANCELLED"         // user dismissed the directory picker
```

#### Resolver (`src/store/persistence/resolver.ts`)

Always returns `IndexedDBAdapter`. The old auto-detection and `tryReconnect` paths are removed. URL override (`?adapter=`) kept for testing but both options return IndexedDBAdapter.

#### Stale Folder Session Detection

On cold start, `init()` checks `localStorage` flag `react-roadmap:folder-open`:
- **Flag set** → user reloaded after a folder session without closing. Force seed data — the FS handle is lost and the IndexedDB data from the folder session can't be saved back to disk.
- **No flag** → normal cold start. Restore IndexedDB data.
- Flag is set by `openFromDisk`, cleared by `closeDisk` and `closeWorkspace`.

#### Deprecated: FSAccessAdapter

`src/store/persistence/fs-access-adapter.ts` implements the old `PersistenceAdapter` interface with auto-save and silent reconnect. Preserved as-is for the legacy `/tiptap-editor-test` route (`TiptapSidebar.tsx`). No production code imports it.

### Query Engine (`src/engine/queries.ts`)
Pure functions over store state — no hooks, no components:

```ts
getEntity(state, id): Entity | undefined
getRelations(state, entityId): Relation[]
getLinkedContext(state, entityId): { entity: Entity; relation: Relation }[]

getContainerChildren(state, containerId, depth?): Entity[]
  // Recursive: returns all descendant segments flattened.
  // Children are ordered by relation.sortOrder (fractional-indexing).
  // Sub-containers (acts, scenes) are kept as visual dividers;
  // their children (speeches, stage directions) follow inline.

resolveContainer(state, entityId): string
  // Walks up `contains` relations to the root (work-level container).

getContainerBreadcrumb(state, containerId): { id: string; title: string }[]
  // Path from root to the given entity (e.g. "Hamlet / Act I / Scene I").
```

Store actions (live `useGraphStore`):

```ts
getEdgesForNode(id, direction?): Relation[]
  // Returns relations scoped to source (out), target (in), or both.

queryThread({ target, relationType }): Entity[]
  // Filters relations by target id + relation type, sorts by sortOrder,
  // maps to source entities. This is the "document" projection primitive.
```

### Reading Viewport
The reading viewport (`src/renderers/ReadingViewport.tsx`) is the legacy renderer (mounted at `/tiptap-editor-test`).

- **Scope**: When the user clicks any entity on the canvas, `resolveContainer` finds the root work. `getContainerChildren` flattens all descendants into a single scrollable list. The root entity (work) renders first as SegmentCard, then all children in order.
- **Navigation**: Free scrolling is the primary interaction. The breadcrumb shows position in the hierarchy. Clicking a breadcrumb item refocuses the root with that item as anchor (same view, scrolled position).
- **SegmentCard variants**: Act, scene, title-page, front-matter, stage-direction, character speech, end-matter, dramatis-personae — each renders with appropriate typography and spacing.
- **Navigation**: The app is a single-mode reading workspace. `focusedEntityId === null` shows the HomePage (root container listing). `focusedEntityId !== null` shows the ReadingViewport with TipTap editing. Sidebar (`AppSidebar`) provides persistent page navigation.

### Graph Canvas
The graph canvas (`src/canvas/GraphCanvas.tsx`) is the spatial/structural renderer at `/`, mounted inside `WorkspaceShell`.

- Renders a full-height React Flow canvas with `Background` (dots), `Controls`, `MiniMap`.
- Entities render as custom `"entity"` nodes (EntityNode component registered at module scope). Relations render as custom `"edgelabel"` edges (EdgeLabel component) with always-visible interactive labels — double-click the label to enter inline edit mode (text input + combobox dropdown of existing relation types).
- **Panel buttons** (top-right): Undo, Redo, Zoom controls, Sidebar trigger. Sidebar and footer chrome (Open Folder, Save, Close Workspace) are owned by `WorkspaceShell`.
- **Interactions:**
  - Double-click pane → creates new node at click position (native DOM `dblclick` listener with capture phase; React Flow's synthetic `onDoubleClick` never fires)
  - Double-click node body → inline text editing (textarea with `nodrag nowheel nopan`, Enter=newline, Escape/blur=commit)
  - Context menu "Edit" on node → triggers inline editing via `editTrigger` counter on node data
  - Double-click edge label → inline editing (text input + combobox; Enter/blur to commit via `updateRelation`, Escape to cancel; dropdown click commits immediately)
  - Drag from node handle → creates edge with type `"related_to"`; source/target handle IDs stored in relation metadata
  - Select + Backspace/Delete → deletes selected nodes/edges (node deletion cascades to relations)
  - Right-click node → context menu (Edit, Delete)
  - Right-click edge → context menu (Delete Edge)
  - Right-click pane → context menu (New Node)
  - `isValidConnection` prevents self-connections
- **Handles:** 4 handles per node (top/right/bottom/left), all `type="source"` — direction captured by source→target in Connection. `BaseHandle` component (14px dot, 2px border, `::before` expansion to ~18px hit area).
- **Resize:** Invisible `NodeResizeControl` on left and right edges (cursor-only, no visible dots). Min width 60px. Top/bottom resize removed — height governed by textarea content.
- **Canvas props:** `zoomOnDoubleClick={false}`, `panOnDrag={false}`, `panOnScroll={true}`, `selectionOnDrag={true}`, `connectionMode={ConnectionMode.Loose}`, `snapToGrid` (16×16), `multiSelectionKeyCode="Shift"`.
- **Sync:** Diff-based — positions live in React Flow state, never the store. Store changes add/remove nodes/edges by ID and merge data labels, preserving user-dragged positions.
- **Layout:** Dagre is disabled (`__experimentalNoDagre`). Node positions are store-authoritative only — user-dragged positions are the sole source of truth. `setCanvasPositions` merges new positions under existing ones (never drops unsaved positions); `replaceCanvasPositions` is used only by the re-layout button for deliberate bulk reset. New nodes enter at cursor/viewport-center via `pendingNodeRef`.
- **Cursor styles:** Pane → `default`, node body → `grab` (dragging → `grabbing`), text → `default`, edge labels → `default`, handles → `grab`. All via CSS with `!important` on pane to override React Flow's inline pointer from `selectionOnDrag`.

### Text View
The text view (`src/components/chrome/TextView.tsx`) is the reading-and-navigation renderer — currently the project's top priority. It shares the same Zustand store as the canvas with zero data duplication.

- **Layout:** Horizontal columns — each open container renders as a 512px-wide independently-scrolling column. An always-present workspace tree column sits at the right end. The outer container scrolls horizontally when columns exceed viewport width.
- **EntityTreeNode** (`src/components/chrome/EntityTreeNode.tsx`) — recursive component: containers render as `Collapsible` + `ContainerCard` with inline-editable title header; segments render as `SegmentCard width="100%"` with inline-editable content. All state reads/writes go through `useGraphStore` — every edit is immediately reflected when switching back to the canvas view.
- **Collapse:** Container collapse is managed by a separate `textCollapsed` set in `useChromeStore`, independent from the canvas's `collapsedContainers`. This keeps the two views' collapse states decoupled.
- **WorkspaceTree** (`src/components/chrome/WorkspaceTree.tsx`) — monospace ASCII tree column showing the full container hierarchy. Clicking a container opens it as a new content column (via `useChromeStore.openContainers`). Root containers: no `contains` incoming edge. Nested containers shown with `├──`/`└──`/`│` connectors.
- **Add segment:** Each container card footer has a `+` button that creates a new segment child via `useGraphStore.addEntity("segment", ...)`. Always visible, even when the container is collapsed.

### Output / State
- `dist/` — production build.
- Store persists through IndexedDBAdapter (`react-roadmap` database in IndexedDB). FSAdapter is invoked only by explicit Save — it writes `graph.json` to a user-picked directory without auto-save. On first visit (no stored data), seed data from `src/data/seed.ts` is loaded automatically.

## Graph & Object Shapes

The canonical shape definitions live in two files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/types/graph.ts` | Core graph primitives — `Entity`, `Relation`, `ViewState`, `GraphSnapshot` |
| `src/types/domain.ts` | Domain-typed entity shapes — `AuthorEntity`, `BookEntity`, and their metadata types (`AuthorMetadata`, `BookMetadata`) |

Entity/Relation shapes in this document are summaries. Always refer to the source files above as the single source of truth.

### Metadata conventions

The `Entity.metadata` field (`Record<string, unknown>`) carries per-entity-type data. The following conventions are documented here (type-system enforcement is deferred to a future PRD):

#### `metadata.lineNumber`

- Type: `number`.
- User decides whether a segment has a `lineNumber` (not enforced by the system).
- Usually present for works with canonical line numbering (plays, poems).
- Usually absent for prose (novels, essays).
- Example: `{ metadata: { character: "barnardo", lineNumber: 1 } }`

#### `metadata.character`

- Type: `string`.
- User decides whether a segment has a `character` (not enforced by the system).
- Usually present in play dialogue lines.
- Usually absent for prose, narration, stage directions, and non-dialogue segments.
